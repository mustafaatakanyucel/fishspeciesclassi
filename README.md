Fish Species Classification Using a Large-Scale Fish Dataset
This project focuses on classifying different species of fish using the A Large-Scale Fish Dataset. The classification task is handled using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.

Project Overview
This project uses image classification techniques to identify fish species from images. The dataset contains images of various fish species, which we pre-process and feed into a deep learning model for classification.

The key components of the project are:

Data Preprocessing: Resizing, normalizing images, and preparing them for model training.
Model Architecture: Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with layers optimized for image recognition.
Model Training: Training the model using the processed fish images.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using accuracy metrics, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of layers for better performance.
